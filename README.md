# HW09A
I started by incorporating some previous in-class code that could identify when a pixel is red or blue and change the color. I knew that yellow would be trickier since it's outside the RGB trichotomy so I tried to incorporate the similarity values outlines in the homework instructions, with a slider to change the value of how close a pixel had to be to the Mondrian yellow to be considered "yellow." I ended up using a dist() function instead of individually calculating the differences between the R/G/B values. I ran into problems with the slider not resetting but I think it was because my slider min/max thresholds were too large because once I addressed that it worked fine. 

# HW09B
I decided to combine my Sol LeWitt code from [HW04] (https://github.com/IDM-6063B-marshall/HW04/blob/main/B/sketch.js) with the camera to render the camera's video in tiny little lines, almost like rainfall. I played around with the colors and shapes and decided that black and white against a black background was an interesting effect and I still like the sketchy skinny little vertical rectangles I used for HW04.

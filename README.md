# HW09 
I started by incorporating some previous in-class code that could identify when a pixel is red or blue and change the color. I knew that yellow would be trickier since it's outside the RGB trichotomy so I tried to incorporate the similarity values outlines in the homework instructions, with a slider to change the value of how close a pixel had to be to the Mondrian yellow to be considered "yellow." I ran into problems with the slider not resetting.
